### Hi there, I'm Tom! ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I'm enrolled in the challenging School of Code bootcamp, which is providing me with the necessary skills and knowledge to become a full-stack developer. This intensive program has challenged me to think creatively and work collaboratively with other students and industry professionals, pushing me to new levels of technical proficiency.

My experience as a ski instructor taught me how to communicate effectively with diverse groups of people, while my freelance design work developed my proficiency in various design software, including the Adobe suite, Blender, and Maya. I'm confident that I can leverage my skills and expertise to create impactful and engaging digital products that prioritize user experience.

I'm enthusiastic about my continued growth and learning as a developer and designer, and I'm eager to use my unique skill set and knowledge from the School of Code bootcamp to make a positive impact in the tech industry.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a collaborative project in a team of 6, developing an app that tackles the issue of finding groups of like-minded people to connect with in your local area.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and SQL.
